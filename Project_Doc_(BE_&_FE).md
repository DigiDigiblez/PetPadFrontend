# Pet Pad App

#### Introduction
This is an app where we put pets before ourselves - logging their every move, and seeking professional advice from their own personal assistant. Pet Pad encompasses the creme dela creme of top notch lavish pet living.

This is Carl Harry Conner Bowen's Capstone project for Udacity's 2020 Full Stack Nanodegree. And my word was it an amazing journey!

It's more than just a degree as people know it, well to me anyway. It's an opportunity to work sleepless nights, grinding to perfection in an industry I love.
