# Pet Pad App

#### Introduction
This is an app where we put pets before ourselves - logging their every move, and seeking professional advice from their own personal assistant. Pet Pad encompasses the creme dela creme of top notch lavish pet living.

It's more than just a degree as people know it, well to me anyway. It's an opportunity to work sleepless nights, grinding to perfection in an industry I love.
